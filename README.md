ReSort
This project aims to develop an Intelligent Recycling System that leverages machine learning and sensor technologies to automate waste classification. By using deep learning models like CNN and YOLO alongside sensors such as inductive and moisture detectors, the system can accurately sort waste into metal, plastic, paper, and organic categories. Designed to improve efficiency and reduce manual labor, this system seeks to enhance recycling rates and lower environmental impact. Future research opportunities include advancements in sensor integration, AI-driven data analysis, and applications in smart city projects to create a more sustainable waste management solution.
